## Abstract

### The Thesis
The subject of our thesis is 'Coded UI Testing'.

We will be doing this on a program, the "Ma√§t" project , that is currently under developement by "Calidos".

The first steps of our thesis are:

* Finding out what "Coded UI Testing" actually is
  * What is Testing Automation
* Learn to work with the Coded UI Tools that are provided by Microsoft, and the new Operating System
  * The Coded UI Test Builder (Visual Studio 2015)
  * UWP / XAML (Visual Studio 2015)
  * Windows 10

When these goals are achieved and the basic knowledge has been absorbed, we can start with the actual objective given to us by Mark Devos.

### Objectives

There are two main goals, or objectives:

* Delivering a "Testing Guideline"
  * How to test the application
  * How to automate testing on the application
* Delivering a "Testing Checklist" as part of the "Testing Guideline"
  * What criteria should be tested to make sure we know when a control or page is fully tested

* Alternatively there will be a document that defines bugs, and information of controls that do not seem to work as intended. This document will also be a part of the "Testing Guideline"

Initially, these documents will be short, but will grow drastically during our internship here at "Calidos"
